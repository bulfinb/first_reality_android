Helpful Dan: When you're fighting you can use long and short range attacks. / Your abilities are long range attacks. Normal attacks are short range. / Abilities only work if no enemies are within normal attack range. / To use a normal attack approach an enemy and Norman will attack them./ Press and hold Norman to build up and use a circular attack./  Norman automatically uses abilities on enemies within range./ Using abilities means you avoid taking damage. Different abilities have different attack ranges. / Abilities also stun enemies by temporarily making them empathise with Norman./ Use the menu button to open the menu. I recommend exploring it.
