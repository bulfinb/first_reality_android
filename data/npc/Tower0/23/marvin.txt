Norman: Looks like things are looking up for you now./ Marvin: Yeah sure. "Join our party, it'll be fun!" they said. They just ignore me./ They spend hours solving the most trivial puzzles you can imagine./ Maybe consult the immeasurably intelligent robot in the party. Nope. Nobody even asks me how I am? / They all have weapons. We fought a boss earlier. What sort of weapon do you think I had./ Norman: A laser? A light sabre? Some advanced technology I can't even imagine? / Marvin: Wrong. Nothing... They gave me nothing. I was KO'd immediately of course./ When they revived me after they were annoyed that I wasn't grateful.
