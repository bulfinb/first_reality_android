Merchant: Oh hello again. Lovely day. You missed quite a spectacle. That adventurer and his groupies ran inside./ There was crystal clear 3D graphics. The tower looked incredible and the princess was so beautiful. / If only my wife didn't drive me to drinking so much, I might have went in with them.
