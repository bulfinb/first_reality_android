duke.jpg/ Duke: Where have you been you invalid? / Norman: Eh. Sorry Sir! / Duke: While you have been off enjoying yourself that kid has been on a rampage. / He has kidnapped the princess. The king is going to have your head over this Norman. / Norman: .... "What the hell am I supposed to do about it." ..../ Duke: Listen this kid and his groupies need to be taken care of. People are talking.... / Duke: There have been signs of rebellious activity among the peasants. 
Tw1.jpg/ The kid is apparently on his way to the north to climb the "Tower of Trials". / You must go there, kill him and bring back the princess before they spread any more unrest./ Norman: ...."Whoa. But they are just kids"... Eh ... Sir?/ Duke: Don't you dare question my authority you insufferable imbecile!/ What was the information Sadie had? 
face_turnip.jpg/ Norman: Just some advice about vegetables Sir. Nothing interesting./ Duke: You were gone for days!! Why are all my henchmen so utterly useless? Get out of my sight.
