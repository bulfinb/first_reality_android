duke.jpg/ Norman: ... Sir! I met the kid. They left the temple with something. I'm not sure what? / Luckily there were no casualties apart from an old man that the building collapsed on. / Duke: You mean they got away? You complete imbecile, what sort of evil henchman are you? / You come back here to tell me he is recruiting party members and collecting artefacts./ ......You should have killed them./ How am I going to explain this to the king? He will have you flogged./ You better redeem yourself. Go to Sadie's house. I heard she may have some useful information. / I sent a guard to clear that troublesome puddle/  Norman: ...."What about my Money".... Sir.. Any chance of the reward or just some Moneys/ Duke: Did you take a knock to the head or something. I'm not paying you for being a total failure.
