duke.jpg/ Norman: ... Sir! I met the trouble makers. (I better make this sound believable.)/ Duke: Excellent.. Tell me more my loyal subject. / Norman: I killed the boy. Made him nice and dead. Nobody will find his treasonous body./ The princess is safe on her way home .... "I should have been an actor" / Duke: You complete half wit. I know they are not dead. Orders came in from the king Today./ They went to the king. He was so happy to see his daughter again he is allowing her to marry Seifer. / Norman: Oh, well it's all OK then. That's great.
Sorceror.jpg/ Duke: I'm afraid not, Norman. We need a cover story for all the trouble stirred up over this./ The anger of the people needs a target. It turns out you're an evil Sorcerers minion. / You must be hung until dead... Report to the cemetery. / Norman: What? No.... Please..../ Duke: Stop babbling like a baby you pathetic worm. Get to the cemetery... NOW IDIOT!!!
